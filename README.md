# Sniffers

[Sniffers main Website](https://dimitrywuyts.github.io/sniffers/)

#### **Who are we?**

- This website was made with love by Dimitry, Ivo, Malik, and Neil.

#### **Why make it?**

- The purpose of this website is to help bring equality to a market that is completely dominated by women's used underwear. 50% of the world's underwear is not being profited on, and we hope to change that.

#### **What is it?**

- This website, apart from being a shining beacon in a dark place, is basically a webshop to buy used men's underwear

#### **Why on Github?** 

- It probably shouldn't be, but in an open source world, we have nothing to hide.
