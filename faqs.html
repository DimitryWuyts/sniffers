<div class="question1">
    <label for="first">Did you buy our poopie underwear and would like to stop?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="first" style="display:none;">
    <div class="hidden">
        <p> You can get professional help with our sniffer psychologist Nelly. Nelly was known to be a underwear thief back in high school and finally got help.<br>
            He has stopped smelling panties for the past 5 years now, although his collegues somehow keep losing theirs without even taking their pants off. </p>

<div class="question1">
    <label for="second">Are you unhappy with your purchase? </label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="second" style="display:none;">
    <div class="hidden">
        <p> Well, you should be. Our products are meant to be a guilty pleasure. So you'll probably feel ashamed soon after sniffing.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="question1">
    <label for="third">You won't give me a refund!</label>
    <input type="checkbox" id="third" style="display:none;">
    <div class="hidden">
        <p> For safety reasons we don't accept returns. <br>Our resident sniffers make sure only the very best gets shipped.<br>
        If for some reason your underwear does not have the desired effect, our personal tester Dimi will personally come to your house to wear and dance around in it untill the desired effect is achieved.</p>

    <input type="checkbox" id="fourth" style="display:none;">
    <div class="hidden">
        <p>This is no problem at all! Our very own catburglar Mike used to break into college dorms stealing underwear for years. <br>
        He is highly trained to get in and out without anybody being any wiser. He can sniff a used underwear from 200m away.</p>
